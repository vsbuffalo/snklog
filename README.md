# 🐍🪵—  Navigate Snakemake logs with ease.

`snklog` is a command-line tool to navigate Snakemake logs with ease. It provides a simple interface to list, tail, and view Snakemake and Slurm log files.

## Features

- List recent Snakemake and Slurm log files
- Tail log files with optional follow mode
- Open log files in the `less` pager
- Print failed rule logs
- Simple and intuitive command syntax

## Installation

`snklog` is designed to be minimal, with no dependencies (yay, no Python packaging!). You can 
install `snklog` directly to your `~/.local/bin` directory (it will create this if you don't have it)
with a single command:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vsbuffalo/snklog/main/install.sh | bash
```
